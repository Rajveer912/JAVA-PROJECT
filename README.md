# JAVA-PROJECT
Project on ATM Management System. 
The ATM (Automated Teller Machine) Management System is a Java-based software application that simulates the functionality of a real-world ATM. 
It provides various banking services such as account balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, cash deposit, and fund transfer to authorized bank account holders. 
The system is designed to provide a secure and convenient way for customers to manage their bank accounts remotely using an ATM machine.
The Java-based ATM Management System is developed using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, making it modular, scalable, and easily maintainable.
The system employs Java's core features such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to model the different components of an ATM and its functionalities.
